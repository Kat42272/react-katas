# Component composition

## User stories:

- In file App.js, the Username component is deep in the react tree, and props are being drilled from the root component all the way through. Avoid prop drilling by using composition, i.e.: Instead of passing the props down the tree, create the component in the root and pass the component itself that uses them

This example is simplified and unrealistic, but in large and complex apps with many components, it may be the case that state will have to be passed down multiple levels to components deep in the react tree.
