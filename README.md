## Setup:

1. The first time you work on these, run `npm install` in the console to download all the dependencies
1. In the file /src/index.js, change line 4 according to what you're working on

## Generate the CSS file

If for some reason you need to regenerate the CSS file /src/style.css (in principle you shouldn't need to), do the following:

1. Transpile the scss file from the root folder with: `sass src/scss/style.scss src/style-transpiled.css` (you need to have sass installed globally)
1. Then run `grunt watch` also from the root folder (you'll need to have grunt installed globally)
